# arduino-mega-pir-passive-infrared-motion-sensor
The Arduino Mega interfaces with a PIR (Passive Infrared) motion sensor module to detect motion by sensing changes in infrared radiation emitted by moving objects. This is ideal for applications such as security systems, automatic lighting, and occupancy detection in smart home projects.
