# PIR Passive Infrared Motion Sensor

#### Project Overview

The PIR Passive Infrared Motion Sensor project utilizes an Arduino Mega to detect motion using a PIR sensor. PIR sensors detect changes in infrared radiation emitted by objects in their field of view, making them ideal for motion detection applications.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **PIR Motion Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the PIR Motion Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **pirSensorPin**: Digital pin connected to the PIR motion sensor (e.g., pin 2).
   - **VCC**: Connect to 5V on Arduino Mega.
   - **GND**: Connect to GND on Arduino Mega.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the PIR motion sensor module to the Arduino Mega as per the circuit setup section.

2. **Library or Dependencies:**
   - No additional libraries are required for basic digital input reading.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

4. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud) to monitor the sensor values.
   - Observe the "Motion detected!" message when motion is detected by the PIR sensor.
   - Verify the "No motion detected." message when there is no motion.

#### Applications

- **Security Systems:** Motion detection for alarm systems.
- **Home Automation:** Trigger lights or appliances based on motion.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Activate lighting only when motion is detected.

#### Notes

- Ensure the PIR sensor is positioned and adjusted according to the detection requirements.
- Adjust sensitivity and delay settings in the sensor if supported by the module.
- Explore integrating PIR sensor data with other components or systems for enhanced functionality.
